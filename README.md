Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up a macOS laptop for web and mobile development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

Requirements
------------

We support:

* macOS Mavericks (10.9)
* macOS Yosemite (10.10)
* macOS El Capitan (10.11)
* macOS Sierra (10.12)
* macOS High Sierra (10.13)
* macOS Mojave (10.14)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested.
Bug reports for older versions are welcome.

Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamsk/laptop/master/mac
```

Review the script (avoid running scripts you haven't read!):

```sh
less mac
```

Execute the downloaded script:

```sh
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

Optionally, review the log:

```sh
less ~/laptop.log
```

Optionally, [install thoughtbot/dotfiles][dotfiles].

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.
If not, copy the lines where the script failed into a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/issues/new) for us.
Or, attach the whole log file as an attachment.
